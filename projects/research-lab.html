      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>As a Research Fellow at the LEICI Institute (UNLP), I work on an applied research project that analyzes physiological signals during exercise and stress episodes in people with type 1 diabetes. This project combines signal processing techniques, data analysis, and machine learning to better understand how physiological systems respond under different conditions.</p>
