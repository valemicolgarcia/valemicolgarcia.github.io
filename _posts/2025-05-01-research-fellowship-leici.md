title: Research Fellowship at LEICI Institute - Analyzing Physiological Signals in Type 1 Diabetes
date: 2025-05-01
---

During my research fellowship at the LEICI Institute (UNLP) from May to December 2025, I worked on a project focused on analyzing physiological signals during exercise and stress episodes in people with type 1 diabetes.

The research project, supervised by **Dra. Ing. Emilia Fushimi** and **Ing. Marcos David Saavedra**, aimed to develop computational methods for analyzing physiological signals to better understand how the body responds to different stimuli in individuals with type 1 diabetes.

## Research Focus

The main objective was to analyze physiological signals collected during exercise and stress episodes. This research is crucial for developing better monitoring and management systems for people with type 1 diabetes, potentially leading to improved treatment strategies and quality of life.

## Technical Approach

The project involved signal processing and analysis techniques, data collection and preprocessing, statistical analysis of physiological patterns, and development of computational models.

## Impact and Learning

This fellowship provided me with valuable experience in biomedical signal processing, research methodology, collaboration with interdisciplinary teams, and application of computer engineering skills to healthcare challenges.

Working at LEICI Institute allowed me to combine my passion for computer engineering with meaningful research that can have a real impact on people's lives.
